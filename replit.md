## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Mobile UX Priority: Top-notch mobile experience is critical since no native app will be developed - mobile-first approach required.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, using Vite for tooling.
- **UI/UX**: Utilizes Shadcn/ui (Radix UI based) and Tailwind CSS for styling, incorporating custom design tokens and supporting light/dark modes. The aesthetic is inspired by Linear and GitHub, with Inter and JetBrains Mono as primary fonts.
- **State Management**: React hooks for local UI state, and TanStack Query for server-side state and data fetching.
- **Routing**: Wouter is used for lightweight client-side routing.
- **Application Structure**: A single-page application design manages authenticated and unauthenticated user states.
- **Navigation**: Desktop view includes a "Dashboard" button in the Profile page header for easy navigation back to the main dashboard. Mobile users navigate via the bottom navigation bar.

### Backend
- **Server**: Express.js on Node.js, written in TypeScript.
- **API**: RESTful architecture with JSON data exchange, secured using Bearer token authentication. Multer handles file uploads.
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication manages phone OTP, with Firebase Admin SDK for server-side token verification.
- **Authorization**: A simple model where authenticated users generally have equal permissions for core functionalities.

### Data Management
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, hosted on Neon (serverless), with Drizzle ORM for type-safe interactions.
- **Schema**: Comprehensive schema covering users, jobs (with attachments), applications, messaging, ideas, skill swaps, broadcasts, admin actions, and events.
- **File Storage**: 
  - Profile photos: `uploads/profiles/` (5MB limit, JPEG/PNG/GIF/WebP)
  - Resumes: Application uploads (5MB limit, PDF/DOC/DOCX)
  - Job attachments: `uploads/job_attachments/` (10MB limit, JPG/PNG/PDF) - allows users to upload company job posting images/PDFs from WhatsApp groups
  - All managed by Multer with strict format and size validation

## Known Issues & Configuration

### Google Calendar Integration (Virtual Skill Swap Sessions)
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Admin Configuration

**Issue:** Virtual skill swap sessions cannot create Google Meet links because the Google Calendar integration has insufficient permissions.

**Current Permissions (Read-Only):**
- `calendar.events.public.readonly`
- `calendar.freebusy`
- `calendar.acls.readonly`

**Required Permissions:**
- `calendar.events` (to create events with Google Meet links)

**Temporary Workaround:**
- Booking virtual sessions will show an error: "Unable to create virtual meeting"
- Users can book in-person sessions instead
- Invalid meeting links have been removed from the database

**Solution for Admin:**
1. Go to Replit Secrets/Tools panel
2. Reconnect Google Calendar integration
3. Ensure OAuth scopes include `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`
4. Test by booking a virtual skill swap session

**Code Location:**
- Backend integration: `server/googleCalendar.ts`
- API endpoint: `POST /api/skill-swap/sessions` in `server/routes.ts`
